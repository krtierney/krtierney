### Hi there 👋

#### I'm Kaitlyn, and I'm available for work.

I'm primarily a full-stack-ish web developer/software engineer/programmer/computers person. Of course, there's no such thing as a truly full-stack developer. I'm stronger on the backend (with a preference for Ruby), but happy to work with anything from terraform to sass, o11y to a11y. 

I live in central London but prefer to work remotely. If there's a good reason to come into the office, and your office is reasonably close to Old Street, and there's not a global pandemic on, I'm happy to show up for meetings or team lunches. If your office has a dog, or is adjacent to a sunny beach in the South Pacific, you may see me far more often.

I have unrestricted right to work in the UK, and as a US citizen, can also work remotely for US companies. I'm currently available for hire, open to anything ranging from part-time to full-time, contract or permanent. You can read a bit [about my background](https://krtierney.com/about/) or find [my CV](https://krtierney.com/cv.pdf) on [my website](https://krtierney.com).

#### 💬 Get in touch if... 

* You'd like to discuss a specific role
* You want to chat about [a book we've both read](https://librarything.com/catalog/kaitlynmeans)
* You have cute animal photos or vids to share
* You can personally recommend a good driving instructor in central London
