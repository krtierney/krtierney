### Hi there 👋

#### I'm Kaitlyn.

I'm primarily a full-stack-ish web developer/software engineer/programmer/computers person. You can read a bit [about my background](https://krtierney.com/about/) or find [my CV](https://krtierney.com/cv.pdf) on [my website](https://krtierney.com).

Here is a list of the work-related things I'm good at and like to do:
 * Learning new things very quickly to a reasonably high standard
 * Clearing blockers, improving process, championing documentation, to help others work better and more efficiently and be self-sufficient. 
 * Finishing things and seeing them through, taking ownership
 * Maintaining code quality through code reviews + pre-review checklists, peer coaching, defining and documenting conventions and style guides
 * Identifying and mitigating risk, with things like carefully crafted release plans for complex work, considering testability and observability
 * Setting or maintaining overall strategic technical direction, alignment with business goals
 * Fostering environments of psychological safety, cohesive team dynamics, shared vision


#### 💬 Get in touch if... 

* You want to chat about [a book we've both read](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/krtierney)
* You have cute animal photos or vids to share
* You will save me from the [mountain of ceramics](https://krtierney.art) piling up in my house by taking some to your house instead
