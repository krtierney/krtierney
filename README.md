### Hi there 👋

#### I'm Kaitlyn.

I'm primarily a full-stack-ish web developer/software engineer/programmer/computers person. You can read a bit [about my background](https://krtierney.com/about/) or find [my CV](https://krtierney.com/cv.pdf) on [my website](https://krtierney.com).

#### 💬 Get in touch if... 

* You want to chat about [a book we've both read](https://librarything.com/catalog/kaitlynmeans)
* You have cute animal photos or vids to share
* You will save me from the [mountain of ceramics](https://krtierney.art) piling up in my house by taking some to your house instead

💅🏻🌈 my pronouns are she/her 
🚫💣 no defense, no ICE, no nazis
